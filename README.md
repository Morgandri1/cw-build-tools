# Cosmwasm Build Tools
A collection of the build tools i've created over the past few months of my CW development journey. most scripts are injective related and may not work on other cosmos chains.

### Organization and usage
Each tool has a folder containing the tool and any of its dependencies, as well as a readme about how to use it. all scripts have been made as modular as possible considering circumstance, but you may need to modify some to work with your project. when in doubt, try it and see, and if that doesnt work, change it.
